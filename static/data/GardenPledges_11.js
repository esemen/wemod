Seeing the birds making use of the hedges in only their second year makes it feel so worthwhile. Our species count stands at 2 reptiles, 6 mammals, 21+ birds, 22+ tree and shrubby species and well over 40 grasses and other herbaceous species. Haven't attempted to count the invert species - that is beyond me, but the ponies, long grass and flowers mean we're seeing plenty of dung beetles, grasshoppers, flower bugs and bees.
